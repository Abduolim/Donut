# Donut Code in Python

## Description
This is a Python program that generates a donut shape using ASCII characters. It is a fun little project that demonstrates the power of mathematics in computer graphics.

The code utilizes principles of trigonometry to calculate the position of each point on the donut shape. By varying the angles and radii, it creates the illusion of a 3D donut shape when viewed in the terminal.
